Installing Docker on Linux
If you wish, Docker can also be installed on many different types of Linux distributions. This note covers how to install with Ubuntu, but the Docker docs have instructions for CentOS, Debian and Fedora as well.



Installation

*Note*: These steps were successfully completed with Ubuntu Desktop 18 LTS

The docs for Ubuntu installation suggest setting up a Docker repository to install and update from.

This is where you should start:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository

After completing the installation steps, test out Docker:

sudo docker run hello-world

This should download and run the test container printing "hello world" to your console.



Installing Docker Compose

Unlike the Mac and Windows Docker Desktop versions, we must manually install Docker Compose. See the instructions for the installation steps (Click on the tab for Linux)

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

After completing, test your installation:

docker-compose -v

This should print the version and build numbers to your console.



Run without Sudo

Follow these instructions to run Docker commands without sudo:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

The docker group will likely already be created, but you still need to add your user to this group.



Start on Boot

Follow these instructions so that Docker and its services start automatically on boot:

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot

Restart your system
